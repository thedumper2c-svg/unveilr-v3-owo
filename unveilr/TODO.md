[/ADD] Add actual implementations (Like LogService, RunService, ...) (PRIORITY 3)
[/ADD] Add support for a function's params being used outside of it, for example:
local x;
function main(a)
    x = a
end
function Callback()
    HumanoidRootPart.Size = Vector3.new(x, x, x)
end
[/ADD] Fix #jobid ~= 30
[/ADD] Add getrawmetatable & things like it (Make sure to make it work with stuff like setrawmetatable() to bypass detections.)
[/ADD] Add http requests & stuff (and add the chainer setting)
[/ADD] Creating too many instances causes performance drops, so...? (Only create stuff when needed!)
[/ADD] Add better control flow detection.. i have no clue how to do this
[/ADD] Fix events
[/ADD] Add http requests
[/ADD] Add :GetFullName()
[/ADD] add TweenInfo.
[/ADD] Make Heartbeat & RenderStepped run the given function 10 times (But don't log anything!)
[/ADD] Optimize CHECKOR and CHECKAND? Doing so will make stuff run at least 3x faster.
[/ADD] Remake prometheus if checks?

[BOT] Add limited finder tier 2
[BOT] Add a better obfuscator compiler
[BOT] Make premium users get a higher timeout number (freemium = 60; tier1 = 60 * 3 * 1; tier2 = 60 * 3 * 2)
[BOT] Make it so there's 1 lune child process per user, use `stdin`. (Idk what to do)

- change your mindset so mar does not keep getting mad at you
